  # Main sticking point of the payload distributions
  ## If we keep the rooms as the primary namespace, we might need to use the wrapper of
  ### command, where the command name is the namespace + path (IE the api path, eg playback.scenes.themes.show)
  #### and the command value is one of the payloads described below.
  ## I think we will need to keep the primary namespace for client registration to individual pipes of messages.
  ## while the contents of the messages are always the same namespaces and schemas.
